# VE.Direct Smart Battery Monitor Interface Firmware for Hurma

This repository provides "production" firmware for the SH-ESP32 device interfacing a Victron Energy BMV-712 battery monitor with the Signal K server on s/y Hurma.

The repository should be usable as is for interfacing any Victron battery monitors with a VE.Direct interface.

For more information, see the README for the [SensESP/VEDirect](https://github.com/SensESP/VEDirect) library.
